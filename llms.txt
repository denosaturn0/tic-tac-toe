# Tic Tac Toe Game - Technical Context

## Architecture Overview

This is a simple command-line Python application implementing the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The codebase follows object-oriented programming principles with a single `TicTacToe` class containing all game logic.

## Key Files and Their Purposes

- `tic_tac_toe.py`: Main game file containing the `TicTacToe` class and `main()` function. This is the entry point for the application.

## Architecture Decisions and Patterns

- **Object-Oriented Design**: The game is encapsulated in a `TicTacToe` class, allowing for easy state management and potential future extensions (e.g., multiple games, AI opponents).
- **State Management**: Game state is maintained through instance variables like `board`, `current_player`, `winner`, etc.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Methods are separated by functionality (display, move validation, win checking, player switching).
- **Input Validation**: Robust error handling for invalid inputs, with user-friendly messages.
- **Immutable Win Conditions**: Winning combinations are predefined as a list of tuples for easy maintenance.

## Data Structures and Logic

- **Board Representation**: A list of 9 strings, initialized with spaces, representing the 3x3 grid.
- **Win Detection**: Checks all 8 possible winning combinations (3 rows, 3 columns, 2 diagonals) after each move.
- **Game Flow**: Main loop in `play()` method handles turns, input, validation, and game end conditions.
- **Player Switching**: Simple toggle between 'X' and 'O'.

## Dependencies and Environment

- **Language**: Python 3.6+
- **External Libraries**: None (uses only built-in Python features)
- **Execution**: Runs as a command-line script, can be made executable on Unix-like systems.

## Business Logic

The core business logic revolves around Tic Tac Toe rules:
- Two players alternate turns placing marks on a 3x3 grid.
- Win condition: Three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
- Tie condition: All spaces filled without a winner.
- Input validation ensures moves are within bounds and on empty spaces.

## Potential Extension Points

- AI opponent integration
- GUI implementation
- Network multiplayer
- Game statistics tracking
- Custom board sizes

## Code Quality Notes

- Well-documented with docstrings
- Clear method names and variable names
- Handles edge cases like invalid input and interruptions
- User-friendly output with emojis for better CLI experience
